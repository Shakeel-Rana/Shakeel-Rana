## 🧠 About Me

I'm a cybersecurity professional with a passion for **offensive security**, **reverse engineering**, and **red team operations**. I design and simulate real-world cyber attacks, build security tools, and develop intelligent IoT systems.

My technical foundation lies in **embedded systems** and **IoT**, using platforms like **ESP32**, **ESP32-CAM**, **Arduino**, and **Raspberry Pi** to build secure, automated, and smart solutions. I enjoy bridging the gap between **hardware engineering** and **cyber defense**.
